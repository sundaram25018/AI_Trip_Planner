# AI Trip Planner

**AI Trip Planner** is a modular, Python-based application designed to help users plan personalized travel itineraries using artificial intelligence. Featuring an interactive web interface powered by Streamlit, the app leverages prompt engineering and agentic logic to generate smart, adaptable trip plans based on user preferences.

## Features

- **AI-driven itinerary generation** using prompt templates and agent logic.
- **Interactive Streamlit web interface** for easy user input and real-time results.
- **Modular architecture** for easy customization and extension.
- **Clear separation of concerns** with dedicated folders for configuration, logging, utilities, and error handling.
